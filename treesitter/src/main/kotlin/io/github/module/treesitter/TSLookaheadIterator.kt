 * A class that is used to look up valid symbols in a specific parse state.

 * Lookahead iterators can be useful to generate suggestions and improve syntax
 * error diagnostics. To get symbols valid in an `ERROR` node, use the lookahead
 * iterator on its first leaf node state. For `MISSING` nodes, a lookahead
 * iterator created on the previous non-extra leaf node may be appropriate.
 *
 * __NOTE:__ If you're targeting Android SDK level < 33,
 * you must `use` or [close] the instance to free up resources.
